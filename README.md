## Overview

# AlertWizard

AlertWizard provides centralized control and structure to alert messages. It uses UIAlertController in a way intended by Apple, while providing compact and transparent methods that are easy to use, as well as framework for managing your own alert messages in an elegant way. 

You can create your own fully custom alert controllers implementing AlertDisplayer protocol, and have them displayed via AlertWizard.  

Store all your alert messages, headers, buttons, ect in an easily localizable .json file

## Installation

AlertWizard is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "AlertWizard"
```

To generate an empty Podfile, navigate to your project folder and execute the following command:

```shell
$ pod init
```

If you do not have CocoaPods installed, run installation command first:

If you do not want to use CocoaPods, you can checkout the repository and copy framework files to your project manually.
